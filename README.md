# Tensorflow-Jetson-TX2

This repository holds prebuilt .whl files for installing Tensorflow on a Jetson TX2.

All .whl files can be found under `Releases` and currently each is built for Jetpack 3.1 (Python 2.7)

ToDo List

- [x] Create Tensorflow wheels (.whl) for Python 2.7 (Jetpack 3.1)
- [ ] Create Tensorflow wheels (.whl) for Python 3.5 (Jetpack 3.1)
- [ ] Create Tensorflow wheels (.whl) for Python 2.7 (Jetpack 3.2)
- [ ] Create Tensorflow wheels (.whl) for Python 3.5 (Jetpack 3.2)
- [ ] Merge repo for creating wheels from compiling Tensorflow source

> NOTE: All wheel files were built from source using Bazel 0.10.1.  Other versions may work, but have note been tested.
